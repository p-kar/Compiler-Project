# Point to Remember while implementing Follow sets
1. If there is a rule A -> aA then follow(A) is in follow(A) is redundant (<otherFunctions>,
    <typedefinitions>, <moreFields>, <declarations>, <otherstmts>, <booleanExpression>).
    Essentially this means we need to handle right recursions in the grammar.
2. Check for infinite loop for the case between <parameterlist> and <remaininglist>.
    <arithmeticRec> and <arithmeticExpression>
    <idlist> and <moreids>
    Essentially handle if there arises a cycle while computing follow sets.
